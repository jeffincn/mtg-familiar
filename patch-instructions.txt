1. Go get the latest version of Gatherer Extractor (google it, should be on MWS forums)
2. Check off whatever sets you please, and then "Actions > Download all data". Don't bother with scans
3. Set up the exported information. The fields to export are:
	Sets: Name, Set Code, Set Code (magiccards.info), Release date
	Cards: ID, Name, Set Type, Rarity, Mana Cost, Converted Mana Cost, Power, Toughness, Loyalty, Ability, Flavor Text, Artist, #, Color
4. "File > Export > XML"
5. Run MtgXml2Json. Give it the XML file, and have it barf the JSON. It will create a .json file and a .json.gzip file.
6. Spot check the .json file to make sure each field has a single char identifier. If it doesnt, go double check the export fields in Gatherer Extractor
7. Upload the .json.gzip to https://sites.google.com/site/mtgfamiliar/patches. Need the password? Ask Adam.
8. Manually edit legality.json, patches.json. and TCGnames.json here https://sites.google.com/site/mtgfamiliar/manifests
	legality.json - self explanatory. check banned/restricted lists, cycle sets into and out of formats, and bump the date
	patches.json - self explanatory, use the regular set code (not magiccards.info). The two should be in sync anyway.
	TCGnames.json - a little trickier. Go look up any card from the new set on tcgplayer.com, for instance http://store.tcgplayer.com/magic/magic-2013-(m13)/aven-squire. The TCG setname is the part before the card name, replacing hyphens with spaces. In this case "Magic 2013 (M13)". Capitalization doesn't matter.
9. Do a quick test and if anything seem fishy, revert to the old patches.json immediately. It happens when you test in production.
10. Profit?
